  title={Relative Income within Households and Time-use of Dual-earner Couples in South Korea},
  author={Anna Kim},
  abstract={Despite the increases in women’s labor force participation and wage over the past decade, the unequal distribution of household labor persists. This study analyzes the impact of spousal relative income on gender disparities in time allocation among dual-earner couples with children, using matched data from the Korean Time Use Survey and Korean Labor and Income Panel Study in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019. As a potentially exogenous measure of wives’ relative income, I utilize a Bartik-style instrument that utilizes region-specific labor demand shocks by interacting variations in preexisting industry employment shares and provincewide average earnings for each industry, excluding the focal area. Using the two-stage least square estimation, the results suggest that when the share of earnings contributed by wives increases by one standard deviation, the time spent in housework by husbands increase by 21 minutes per day, whereas wives remain unchanged. Additionally, as the wives’ earnings increase, husbands and wives allocate more time to childcare, especially caring for younger children. Finding no empirical evidence for increased bargaining power for wives, I argue that gender role norms may instead be responsible for the gendered division of nonmarket work.},
